<h3>Steve Best | Lead Installer and Project Manager</h3>
"My team of tradesmen is the best around. I've learned through trial and error that the most important thing I can do is to surround myself with tradesmen who are truly skilled and take extraordinary pride in the quality of their work."

Steve grew up just outside of NYC in the beautiful town of Fairlawn, NJ. Steve, always popular for his kindness and athleticism, was a state-ranked wrestling champ, football captain, and lacrosse captain. As a young man, he chose to enter the tile trade precisely because it was so physically challenging. His tile apprenticeship began in NJ with his mentor, Glen Ferrara, and lasted over seven years where Steve was trained in traditional Italian methods handed down through generations; Steve's knowledge and skills are truly a dying art in the American trades.
Twenty years later, Steve now oversees other master-level installers and personally manages every project while still maintaining his craft by keeping his hands "in a bucket of cement" every day. Over his career he has expanded his mastery of custom / luxury tile installation to include full-scale residential and commercial remodeling projects. Steve enjoys nothing more than the challenge of exceeding client expectations; he prides himself on giving clients exactly what they want. His passion, dedication, and honesty earned him an reputation in the industry that he strives to maintain. He visits his home state of New Jersey several times a year and attends a New York Giants game with boyhood friends, but always wears his Bears cap seated 4th row in Giants stadium. He is the proud father of five beautiful, joyful children.

<h3>Andrea Best | Business Manager</h3>
"This isn't just a job, it's a calling. I want my clients to know that I wouldn't settle for mediocre workmanship in my own home, and I command excellence on behalf of my clients too."
Andrea grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, and always had a passion for fine arts, crafts, and trades. She found inspiration for the remodeling business through her travels and education, particularly in New York. She received her B.F.A. in Printmaking with an emphasis on Ceramics and a B.S. Ed. in Art Education from the University of Georgia - Athens. Andrea worked for eight years as an art educator in a top public middle school in the northwest suburbs prior to entering the remodeling industry. Andrea's interest in artistic tile began in her late teen years, when she would scour antique stores for the old Victorian-era tiles. Her focus on ceramics during her college years only intensified her interest in both tile manufacturing and tile design/installation. With her incredible passion for both high-American crafts and home design, when the opportunity came for Andrea to join the team she felt it to be the chance of a lifetime. She began carving the path for Best Tiling to emphasize its niche Chicagoland market with homeowners and designers who truly value aesthetics. As a teacher, one of her classroom mottos was "mediocrity is not an option" and she carries that attitude to the remodeling business. She strives for excellence and demands that her clients receive it. In addition, she strives to act as a consumer advocate for clients through product and process education. She is the proud mother of five passionate and brilliant kids.

<h3>Alex Homola | Master Tile Setter &amp; Renaissance Man</h3>
Alex grew up in the Czech Republic and moved to Chicago sixteen years ago. From an early age he liked working with his hands and had a natural curiosity about how things worked. This coupled with his creativity made Alex a natural at tile setting. He is also skilled in carpentry and electrical work. Alex takes great pride in his work and loves to see a happy customer. Outside of work, he loves to ski, play hockey, ride his motorcycle and play with his two boys. There isn’t a challenge that Alex won’t accept, although he admits, eating hot peppers may be one.

"I still can't get over the fact that from start to finish it took just one week for Best Tiling to do all of the work. They always showed up when they said they would, and I couldn't believe how quickly they did my project. I know many people who go through bathroom remodels for six weeks. Also, they were always polite and professional, and I felt like they respected my home and kept dust to a minimum and cleaned-up properly. I am the type of person who asks lots of questions, I want to understand what the contractor is doing before he does it, and they were always willing to answer my questions and returned my calls promptly. I have had them out again to look at a repair in my other bathroom, and was given their professional opinion on how to handle the problem I'm having in the other bathroom for no charge at all. It's good to know that there are honest contractors out there who do good work, and I would recommend Best Tiling to anyone."
